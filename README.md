Internal Stuff, removed before release

### Ideas

- [Using Systran.io as API](https://platform.systran.net/index)
  - Later: [Linguee](https://github.com/imankulov/linguee-api)
  - Sample Sentences
- Login-Page: Every user has his/her own account
- Language selection: Users can learn different languages. For every language they've got their 'personal dictionary'
- Users can add vocabulary to their dictionary
- Progress:
  - All vocabularies have a progress (numbers 1 - 3)
  - Progress shows how well the user already knows a word
- Vocabulary training:
  - User can set options:
    - How many words are asked?
    - Shall only words with a certain progress level be asked?
    - Which direction shall be asked?
  - After the vocabulary training there's a summary showing if the translations were right
- Settings:
  - How many right guesses in a row shall lead to a new progress level?
