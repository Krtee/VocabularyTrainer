## Vocabulary Training App

App to train the vocabulary

### Ideas

* [Using Systran.io as API](https://platform.systran.net/index)
* Login-Page: Every user has his/her own account
* Language selection: Users can learn different languages. For every language they've got their 'personal dictionary'
* Users can add vocabulary to their dictionary
* Progress:
  + All vocabularies have a progress (numbers 1 - 3)
  + Progress shows how well the user already knows a word
* Vocabulary training:
  + User can set options:
    - How many words are asked?
    - Shall only words with a certain progress level be asked?
    - Which direction shall be asked?
  + After the vocabulary training there's a summary showing if the translations were right
* Settings: 
  + How many right guesses in a row shall lead to a new progress level?
