## Vocabulary Training App

App to train the vocabulary

### Ideas

* [Using Systran.io as API](https://platform.systran.net/index)
* Login-Page: Every user has his/her own account
* Language selection: Users can learn different languages. For every language there's a 'personal dictionary'
* Users can add vocabulary to their dictionary
* Progress:
  + All vocabularies have a progress
  + Progress shows how well the user already knows a word
* Vocabulary training:
  + User can set options
    - How many words are asked?
    - Shall only words with a certain progress be asked?
    - Which direction shall be asked?
* Learning by categories or difficulty
